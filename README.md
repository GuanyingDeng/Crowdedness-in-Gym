# Crowdedness-in-Gym
This study attempted to use statistical models and analysis to explain the pattern of crowdedness in a college gym. We looked at different factors that could potentially influence the number of people in a college gym, such as the time of the day, whether or not is weekend or holiday, whether or not is during a semester, and the temperature of the day. This study provided a general idea about the crowdedness of the gym based on different conditions, from the statistical perspective of model fitting, model diagnosis, and model prediction.
